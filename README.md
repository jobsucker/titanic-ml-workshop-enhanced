# ML Workshop Enhancement: Diving deeper into Titanic survival with Machine Learning

This Jupyter Notebook was initially used to conduct a hands-on Machine Learning workshop with Python in Brazil, under the patronage of [WoMakersCode Community](https://github.com/WoMakersCode). Now, it has been refined and expanded for an improved learning experience.

The notebook presents a reliable Machine Learning solution for a renowned Kaggle Competition. Find more details about the original challenge here: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and learning purposes. It's simple!

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Jupyter Notebook (Use of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is suggested)

### Download/Clone repository

Download or clone this repository to your machine. It includes a jupyter notebook and the Titanic dataset.

### Kickstart your own `Jupyter Notebook`

**Windows**

In the project folder with all the files from this repository, launch cmd and execute the command `jupyter notebook`. Here's what your cmd should look like:
