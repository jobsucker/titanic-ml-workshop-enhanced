# ML Workshop Enhancement: Diving deeper into Titanic survival with Machine Learning

This Jupyter Notebook was initially used to conduct a hands-on Machine Learning workshop with Python in Brazil, under the patronage of [WoMakersCode Community](https://github.com/WoMakersCode). Now, it has been refined and expanded for an improved learning experience.

The notebook presents a reliable Machine Learning solution for a renowned Kaggle Competition. Find more details about the original challenge here: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
